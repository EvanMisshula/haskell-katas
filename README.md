# Haskell Katas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adomokos/haskell-katas.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/adomokos/haskell-katas?branch=solutions)

As I try to learn Haskell, I realized reading and following examples is not enough, I needed short examples I could practice daily.

The examples in this repo are mostly from the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), although I started incorporating other examples as well.

`stack build` should get you going and `stack test` will run all the specs. You are done, when all the specs are passing.
